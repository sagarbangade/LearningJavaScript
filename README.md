# Learning Javascript

## Introduction

This repository contains a collection of basic JavaScript exercises organized into different categories. Each category focuses on fundamental programming concepts such as arrays, conditionals, and loops. These examples are meant to help beginners understand and practice JavaScript through simple problem-solving.

## Folder Descriptions

### 1. Arrays

This folder contains JavaScript files that demonstrate operations on arrays, such as iterating through elements, calculating sums, and other array manipulations.

**File:** `array.js`  
**Description:** This script calculates the sum of all elements in an array and prints the result.

### 2. Conditionals

This folder includes JavaScript files that focus on conditional statements like `if`, `else`, and `else if` to control the flow of the program based on certain conditions.

**File:** `conditional.js`  
**Description:** This script checks whether a given number is even or odd and outputs the result.

### 3. Loops

This folder contains JavaScript files that demonstrate the use of loops (`for`, `while`) to execute code repeatedly based on a condition.

**File:** `loop.js`  
**Description:** This script prints numbers from 1 to 10 using a `while` loop.

## Instructions on How to Run the Files

To run any of the JavaScript files in this repository, follow these steps:

1. **Navigate to the Folder:**

   - Open your terminal or command prompt.
   - Use the `cd` command to navigate to the folder containing the script you want to run. For example:
     ```bash
     cd LearningJavascript/Arrays
     ```

2. **Run the Script:**

   - Ensure you have Node.js installed on your computer. If not, download and install it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
   - Run the script using the `node` command. For example:
     ```bash
     node array.js
     ```

3. **View the Output:**
   - The script's output will be displayed in the terminal.

Feel free to explore each folder and run the examples to practice and understand basic JavaScript concepts!
